# covid19api_check_validity
Checking the validity of the data coming from the covid19api so we can confirm with the community

## Why check validity?
I was using this API to pull in covid-19 data to explore what types of models or information I can create for the community,
but I've noticed a problem with the China data and I wanted to share it with the community. I hope it's my mistake because I
know that many people are using this API and it would be a shame if the problem is with the data.
