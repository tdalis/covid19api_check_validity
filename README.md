# covid19api_pull_and_fix_data
Using this small script you can make sure that the data you pull from the Covid19API is sorted for the latest date

## Why keep only latest date?
If you don't do that, you might run into problems such as visualising and analysing the data with duplicated values.

# Contact me
If you find the problem (whether is my mistake or a data mistake), please contact me at tasos@tasospardalis.com or on Twitter @tdalis

# Next step
Naturally, I'll have to write code to break the data down to daily level for this API. I hope to get the time to do that soon, if you want to help or have the code already, let me know.
